davidthefrikr here, this is literally the jankiest method that i could 
get this command to work from its separate .js file

i was trying to get it to just reuse stuff from index.js but variables 
are reeeeally disgusting with javascript and i'm not proficient enough 
in js to figure that out

THIS 100% NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP AND MADE MORE EFFICIENT IN THE FUTURE
THIS 100% NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP AND MADE MORE EFFICIENT IN THE FUTURE
THIS 100% NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP AND MADE MORE EFFICIENT IN THE FUTURE

also if it ain't broke then don't fix itâ„¢
